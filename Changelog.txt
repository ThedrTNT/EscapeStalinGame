v3::
-made platform and hazard work with scrolling world
bugs:
-player spawns at x = 0 of the current screen, not of the entire level
goals:
-make player spawn at same point with scroll world (if x = 0 is the beginning of the scroll world, make him spawn at that point even if it is off the screen)
	-track player location throughout the level
	-track object location throughout the level
	-calculate and reset accordingly for every player death

v4::
-changed tester to be more defined towards edges for testing purposes
-changed scroll algorithm to allow player to move to edge of screen when at the end of the world
-player now respawns 100 pixels away from the hazard after colliding in the opposite direction that was being travelled
bugs:
-currently only works with one size of scroll world
goals:
-abstract scroll code in player constructor to work with multiple world sizes(basically make give it an int in the constructor and just pass it from the world

v5::
-uhhh I think I added the patrol but it's pretty useless so rip

v6(idk where v5 is lol)::
-updated death and respawn system so player now spawns at beginning regardless of location within world
-updated testground by making it a MayflowerImage and passing its width into player constructor (thats how we use multiple world sizes)
bugs:
-after first respawn player cannot backtrack on the first 200 pixels of world
goals:
-fix bug
-begin adding collectable objects (keys, letters)
	-letters: is only important to track for ending of game, very simple
	-keys: required to move from level to level, not as simple
-update platforms to have proper collision
-update platform location and/or jump height

v8::
-added getter methods for letters and lives
-when colliding with a hazard the life instance variable is reduced by one
-if life is zero the world is changed to the game over screen
-StartScreen displays remaining lives and the amount of letters collected
-implemented the door
-if the player does not have a key the door displayes a message
-if player has key world switches to titlescreen as placeholder
goals:
-add in the 2d array because you didn't upload that version
-start getting the final sprites for every object and begin the process of animating


v9(bc ryan is stupid and doesn't save these)::
-added 2d array level builder
-everything works as previously, just more simplified for more variation and addition of more than 10 platforms/hazards
-level size update (width = 5000px height = 768px)
-added new title screen and title music
bugs:
-none really atm
goals:
-finish 2 full levels (hazards, keys/doors, letters)
-add ladders(?)
-begin work on real assets
	ideal pace:
	-title/end screens
	-background of levels
	-foreground of levels
	-platforms
	-letters
	-keys
	-doors
	-player animations

v9.1::
-extended length of test world image
-updated moving label to move with world
maybe changes:
-change the randomizing algorithm for level builder
for sure changes:
-height of player must decrease by at least 50px

v10::
-added oof sounds
-created world 2
-world switches to next level when key is held
goals:
-make the world generation less terrible

v11::
-added player animations for walking, idle, and jumping
-updated assets for door, key, platform, letter, and hazard
